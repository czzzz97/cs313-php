		<h3>What is a roguelike?</h3>
		<p id="big_a">@</p>
		<p>This class of games, spawned in the time of text-only computers, originally
		consisted of a purely ASCII environment. You played as a "@", and fought goblins ("g")
		and other monsters, while grabbing gold ("$") and other items.
		Modern roguelikes often discard the ASCII graphics but maintain the other elements
		 of roguelikes which include: random generation (no 2 playthroughs are the same), 
		 permadeath (when your character dies, he is lost forever and you must start over),
		  and turn-based strategy (nothing moves until you move).</p>

		<h3>Ancient Domains of Mystery</h3>
		<p>One of the classical roguelikes, and the first I ever played. ADOM has
		many unexplained mechanics, and difficult controls for a new player: each
		key on the keyboard has its own action. So you press 't' to fire a bow, 's' to
		search your surroundings...etc. It's incredibly rewarding when mastered.</p>
